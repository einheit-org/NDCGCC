                The Good Governance Card is an innovative initiative introduced
                by the National Democratic Congress (NDC) in Ghana. It aims to
                revolutionize campaign funding by actively involving ordinary
                Ghanaians and the middle class in the political process.

                The main goal of the Good Governance Card is to promote good

                </span>{' '}
                <br />
                The initiative empowers ordinary Ghanaians and the middle class
                by providing them with a platform to actively engage in the
                political process. It encourages citizens to contribute their
                ideas, resources, and expertise, recognizing that real change
                can only be achieved when all segments of society are involved.

                  What does inclusivity and representation mean in the context

                </span>{' '}
                <br />
                Inclusivity and representation refer to breaking down barriers
                and welcoming individuals from diverse backgrounds and
                professions. The Good Governance Card ensures that the voices
                and interests of ordinary Ghanaians and the middle class are
                represented in the political discourse, strengthening
                Ghana&apos;s democratic fabric.

                <br />
                The initiative seeks to change the perception that political
                participation is distant or exclusive. By involving citizens in
                the campaign funding process, the Good Governance Card sends a
                powerful message that their opinions and contributions matter,
                motivating them to take a more active role in shaping
                Ghana&apos;s future.

                <br />
                No, the Good Governance Card ensures financial inclusion by
                providing an opportunity for individuals from various income
                levels to make meaningful contributions to the NDC&apos;s
                campaign efforts. This democratizes the fundraising process,
                making every contribution count.

                <br />
                When citizens see that their participation and contributions are
                valued and utilized ethically, it fosters a sense of trust and
                confidence in the democratic process. This belief in positive

                party&apos;s policies and decision-making processes. Involving a
